Baseline
========

Simply a collection of css files that I use as a baseline for getting started with a project, this is a collection of various frameworks such as [960.gs](http://github.com/nathansmith/960-Grid-System) and useful objects to use in a project like icons and such. I have this setup because I didn't want to have to repeat myself every single time I start working on a project.

Included in this collection

- 960.gs, 12 columns, fixed & fluid (with slight modifications) - Generated from [http://www.spry-soft.com/grids/](http://www.spry-soft.com/grids/)
