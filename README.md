Baseline
========

Simply a collection of css files that I use as a baseline for getting started with a project, this is a collection of various frameworks such as [960.gs](http://github.com/nathansmith/960-Grid-System) and [formalize](http://host.sonspring.com/formalize/) to get up and running quick with a project. This is mainly a nice set of defaults that I like to use.

Plug and Play
=============
    
    // Clone it into whatever project you're working on and then
    git clone http://github.com/vanntastic/baseline you/project/directory/baseline
    
    // Assuming you cloned it into baseline
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="baseline/baseline.css" type="text/css" media="screen" 
          title="Baseline" charset="utf-8">
    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.formalize.js"></script>
